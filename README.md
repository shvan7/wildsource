## About
The Wild Code School is teaching students how to develop websites and mobile apps. At the Paris campus, the trainers are providing every week lots of useful contents online such as lessons, livecodings, exercises, etc.
As a group of students of the current promotion, we identified a need : improve access for pupils to those very useful resources and give feedback to the trainers about these. In order to achieve this, we are developing a platform with an intuitive interface and easy access for the students, and also a simplified back-office for the trainers to update new contents regularly.
